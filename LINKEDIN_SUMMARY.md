# DevOps CI/CD Pipeline Project - LinkedIn Summary

## 🎯 One-Line Description
Built a production-ready CI/CD pipeline automating the complete software delivery lifecycle from code commit to Kubernetes deployment with comprehensive monitoring.

 A Complete DevOps CI/CD Pipeline! 🚀

Over 15 days, I built a production-grade pipeline from scratch demonstrating:

✅ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
✅ Configuration Management (Ansible)
✅ 13-Stage Automated Pipeline (Jenkins)
✅ Code Quality & Security Scanning (SonarQube, Trivy)
✅ Container Orchestration (Kubernetes on AWS EKS)
✅ Real-time Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)

**Key Achievement:** Automated deployment from code push to production in under 10 minutes with zero manual steps.

**Tech Stack:** AWS | Jenkins | Docker | Kubernetes | Terraform | Ansible | Maven | Trivy | SonarQube | Nexus | Prometheus | Grafana

**What makes this special:**
- Dual security scanning (filesystem + container images)
- Multi-stage pipeline with quality gates
- High availability deployment across multiple zones
- Complete observability with custom dashboards

The journey from beginner to building this was challenging but incredibly rewarding. Documented every error, solution, and lesson learned.


The Unexpected Lesson?
Documentation is everything. Every error I faced (and solved) is now documented for others.

Tech used: AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible, and 9 more tools.
